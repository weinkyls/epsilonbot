# Install ARMbian

Download from
https://www.armbian.com/rock-5b/
the image "Armbian 25.8.2 Bookworm Minimal / IOT".

Call `armbian-config` and upgrade to Debian "trixie".

# Enabling PWM drivers and UART in armbianEnv.txt

Start `sudo nano /boot/armbianEnv.txt`, identify these lines and add/edit them that
they look like these:

```
console=display
overlay_prefix=
overlays=rk3588-pwm14-m0 rk3588-pwm8-m0 rk3588-uart2-m0
```

This enables the UART and PWM on the pins 33 and 34 on the 40 pin header.

# Change permissions for PWM

Create the group `gpio`:

```
groupadd gpio
```
and add yourself and other users to it who want to write to the PWM device.

Copy the file [90-gpio.rules](90-gpio.rules) to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`. This will
make sure that the PWM can accessed by any user who's in the gpio group.
